Cluster Setup


This repository showcases the steps needed in order to setup an HPC cluster. The cluster includes FreeIPA installation, Slurm, Environment Modules, and installing programs to be used in the environment modules. All of the steps were done by me (Kristen) with the existing NIP-SanD cluster as a guide.
